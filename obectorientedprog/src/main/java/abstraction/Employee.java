calculateSalary() as an abstract method. The Contractor class inherits  
all properties from its parent Employee but have to provide its own  
implementation of calculateSalary() method and multiply the value  
of payment per hour with given working hours. The  
FullTimeEmployee also has its own implementation of  
calculateSalary()method. In this case we just multiply by constant 8  
hours.*/
